#define DEFAULT_LED_COUNT 5
```

**Serial Monitor Should Show:**
```
LEDs initialized: 60 pixels
```

## 🌐 Can't Access Web Interface

### Symptoms: Browser can't load webpage

**Check AP Mode (First Boot):**
- [ ] Look for WiFi network "AquariumLED"
- [ ] Password: aquarium123
- [ ] Browse to: http://192.168.4.1
- [ ] Device within WiFi range

**Check Station Mode:**
- [ ] Device connected to your WiFi
- [ ] Check serial monitor for IP address
- [ ] Try: http://aquariumled.local
- [ ] Try: http://[ip-address]
- [ ] Ping device from terminal

**Check Filesystem:**

- [ ] Serial shows "Filesystem mounted"
- [ ] Re-upload if needed

**Try:**
```bash
# Re-upload filesystem
pio run -t uploadfs -e esp8266

# Check upload log for errors
```

**Serial Monitor Should Show:**
```
Filesystem mounted
Web server started
IP Address: 192.168.1.xxx
```

## 📡 WiFi Connection Issues

### Symptoms: Won't connect to WiFi network

**Check Credentials:**
- [ ] SSID spelled correctly (case-sensitive)

**Force AP Mode:**
```cpp
// In main.cpp, temporarily:
// WiFi.begin(config.network.ssid.c_str(), config.network.password.c_str());
WiFi.mode(WIFI_AP);
WiFi.softAP("AquariumLED", "aquarium123");
```

- [ ] Use thicker wire gauge for long runs
- [ ] Power injection every 2-3 meters

**Check Grounds:**
- [ ] ESP ground to LED ground
- [ ] LED ground to power supply ground
- [ ] All grounds at same potential
- [ ] No loose connections

**Check Data Line:**
- [ ] Add 470Ω resistor if missing
- [ ] Use twisted pair for data + ground
- [ ] Keep data wire short (<3 feet ideal)
- [ ] Use level shifter (3.3V → 5V)
- [ ] Check for EMI sources nearby

**Check Settings:**
- [ ] Reduce brightness temporarily
- [ ] Try slower effects
- [ ] Check LED type/color order
- [ ] Update FastLED library

**Try:**
```cpp
// In main.cpp:
FastLED.setMaxPowerInVoltsAndMilliamps(5, 1500); // Limit power
```

## 🎨 Wrong Colors

### Symptoms: Colors don't match or look incorrect

**Check LED Type:**
- [ ] WS2812B vs SK6812 (different chipsets)
- [ ] RGB vs RGBW (4-channel)
- [ ] Check datasheet

**Check Color Order:**
Try different orders in config:
- [ ] GRB (WS2812B default)
- [ ] RGB
- [ ] BGR
- [ ] BRG

**Check Power:**
- [ ] Voltage at strip (should be 5V)
- [ ] Voltage drop on long strips
- [ ] Brown-out causing color shift

**Check First LED:**
- [ ] First LED often wrong color (expected)
- [ ] Add 470Ω resistor to fix
- [ ] Use level shifter

**Serial Monitor:**
```
Check LED type: WS2812B
Color order: GRB
```

**Check NTP Server:**
- [ ] Default: pool.ntp.org
- [ ] Try: time.google.com
- [ ] Try: time.nist.gov
- [ ] Check geographic NTP pools

**Check Timezone:**
- [ ] Timezone offset correct (hours from UTC)
- [ ] Example: EST = -5, PST = -8
- [ ] DST setting if applicable

**Serial Monitor Should Show:**
```
Waiting for time sync...
Time synchronized!
```

**Try:**
```json
{
  "time": {
    "ntpServer": "time.google.com",
    "timezoneOffset": -5
  }
}
```
