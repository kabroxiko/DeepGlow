## Build and Deployment Automation

This skill outlines the common tasks for building and deploying the project.

### Building the Firmware

*   **Command:** `source .venv/bin/activate && platformio run -e esp32c6_debug`
*   **Example:** To build for the primary ESP32-C6 debug environment, run:
  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate && platformio run -e esp32c6_debug
  ```
*   Always activate the Python virtual environment before building.
*   You can also use the "Build for esp32c6_debug" task available in the workspace.

### Building the Web Interface

*   **Command:** `npm run build`
*   **Action:** This command, defined in `package.json`, uses Vite to compile the React application into static assets located in the `web/dist` directory.

### Embedding Web Assets into Firmware

*   **Action:** After building the web interface, the static files must be converted into C++ headers to be included in the firmware.
*   **Command:** `python scripts/embed_assets.py`
*   **Full Workflow:**
    1.  `npm run build` (in the `web` directory)
    2.  `python scripts/embed_assets.py` (from the project root)

### Cleaning the Build Environment

*   **Command:** `platformio run --target clean`
*   **Action:** Removes compiled object files and firmware binaries, which is useful for forcing a complete rebuild.

### Uploading Firmware to Device

*   **Command:** `platformio run -e <environment_name> --target upload`
*   **Action:** Builds the firmware and uploads it to the connected device.
